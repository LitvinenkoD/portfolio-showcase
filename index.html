          <p class="welcome-section__paragraph generic-paragraph">I am looking for a CS internship in Summer 2024. I have prior experience in frontend webdev, however I really want to get into other fields! I've taught myself HTML CSS and JavaScript including React, have developed a commercial website for a real client, but now I want to move on and start doing things that really interest me. I'm talking Software Engineering, System management, and the good stuff on the back end of things. Hope I find a position that I can really fall in love with!</p>

      <p class="project__paragraph generic-paragraph">This project was the most important one I've ever done. This was my first and only real commercial product that I sold to a NJ painting company owner. I did everything - interviewing the client, setting up a price and a timeframe to deliver it, design the actual layout in Figma (that took way too long), helped them set up and purchase a domain and host the website, and overall, this project feels like a child of mine. It's a mixture of marketing, web design, web development, sales and product management. Amazingly rewarding experience, didn't make much money off of it.</p>

It just seems more fun to add some variation. I must say I'm proud of the animations I made for this site, and overall, although simple in functionality, I find it a nice and neatly looking app.</p>
